# Overview

This project leverages Flask and Socket.IO to create an interactive, user-friendly chat environment where users can join rooms, see participants, and have live conversations. This project helps in understanding the intricacies of WebSockets, event-driven programming, and real-time data updates.

The chat application provides users with the ability to create and join chat rooms, see who is online in each room, and exchange messages in real-time. It serves as a foundational platform for more complex real-time applications, offering insights into both frontend and backend development.
